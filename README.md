# AI-Driven Personalized Learning Companion

## Description
### **Background**
Traditional learning systems often fail to accommodate neurodiverse students who have unique learning needs. Many struggle with rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches that do not consider differences in attention, processing speed, or sensory preferences. This AI-driven learning companion aims to bridge that gap by offering a **personalized, adaptive, and inclusive** educational experience.

### **Who Is It For?**
- **Neurodiverse students** (e.g., students with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, or other learning differences) who need tailored learning experiences.
- **Educators and parents** looking for tools to support individualized learning.
- **Schools and institutions** that want to integrate AI-powered, assistive learning technologies.

### **How It Works**
This AI-driven learning companion adapts to students' learning styles using:
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** – To analyze learning patterns and adjust content delivery.
- **Emotional AI** – Detects emotions and provides encouragement or modifications based on frustration levels.
- **Assistive Technologies** – Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and dyslexia-friendly fonts for better accessibility.
- **Multi-Sensory Learning Support** – Integrates text, audio, visual aids, and interactive elements to engage different types of learners.

### **Use Cases**
- A student with dyslexia can use **text-to-speech** to listen to lessons instead of reading.
- A child with ADHD can get **interactive, bite-sized lessons** to maintain engagement.
- An AI-driven chatbot can **offer encouragement** when the student seems frustrated.
- Customizable lesson plans allow **teachers to personalize assignments** based on student needs.

### **Future Goals**
We aim to expand the project with:
- **Gamification elements** to increase engagement.
- **Progress tracking dashboards** for students, parents, and teachers.
- **AI-powered study recommendations** based on performance analytics.

## Features
- **Personalization:** Adapts to individual learning styles and needs.
- **Multi-Sensory Learning:** Supports text, audio, video, and interactive elements.
- **Emotional AI:** Detects student emotions and adjusts responses accordingly.
- **Assistive Technologies:** Includes speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and dyslexia-friendly fonts.
- **Inclusivity:** Designed with accessibility and neurodiversity in mind.
